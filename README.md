# room-booking-website
book and store a room in a database linked booking site  
the website uses php, html, css and some js 
it has 3 main pages; delhi, next and bookings 
rest all are either the picture files or js/css files  


you will need to activate xampp for this website to work 
xamp provides you with the database and acts as a local host for the website 
install it and activate it 
move all of the files to a subfolder in the "htdocs" folder 

open "delhi.php" from the local host server by typeing the following url "http://localhost/dsw/delhi.php" (after activating xampp)
the website should work....
feel free to ask anything if you get stuck any where
